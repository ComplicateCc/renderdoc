RenderDoc is a frame-capture based graphics debugger, currently available for Vulkan, D3D11, D3D12, OpenGL, and OpenGL ES development on Windows, Linux, Android, and Nintendo Switch&trade;. It is completely open-source under the MIT license.

TA 新增功能
--------------

当前分支包含最近几天新增的 TA 向调试扩展：

* **Shader 静态分支精简**：Shader 编辑窗口新增 `Strip Branches` 操作，可根据静态 `#define` 宏求值预处理分支，移除不会执行的 shader 代码路径，并可通过 `Keep macros` 选择是否保留原始宏定义。
* **纹理替换工作流**：Texture Viewer 支持 replay 纹理替换、替换预览、替换后刷新缩略图和相关视图、压缩纹理格式替换，并使用 RGBA / flat-normal proxy texture 降低预览路径风险。
* **D3D11 替换正确性**：D3D11 纹理替换路径会保持 descriptor canonical，并让预览路径走 replacement resource，减少 replay 检查时的状态不一致。
* **CBuffer 编辑支持**：TA CBuffer 工具支持编辑常量缓冲变量，并补充了读写闭环、局部字节范围 patch、offset 语义和错误信息等验证要求。
* **TA 性能查看**：新增 TA Performance Tree Viewer 和 pass/draw diff 辅助能力，用于补充 replay 中的性能向检查视图。

更多说明见 [docs/ta_weekly_feature_updates.md](docs/ta_weekly_feature_updates.md)、[docs/ta_renderdoc_cbuffer_development_retrospective.md](docs/ta_renderdoc_cbuffer_development_retrospective.md) 和 [docs/ta_performance_viewer.md](docs/ta_performance_viewer.md)。

RenderDoc is intended for debugging your own programs only. Any discussion of capturing programs that you did not create will not be allowed in any official public RenderDoc setting, including the issue tracker, discord, or via email. For example this includes capturing commercial games that you did not create, or capturing Google Maps or Google Earth. Note: Capturing projects you created that use a third party engine like Unreal or Unity, or open source and free projects is completely fine and supported.

If you have any questions, suggestions or problems or you can [create an issue](https://github.com/baldurk/renderdoc/issues/new/choose) here on github, [email me directly](mailto:baldurk@baldurk.org) or come into [IRC](https://webchat.oftc.net/?channels=renderdoc) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/ahq6yRB) to discuss it.

To install on windows run the appropriate installer for your OS ([64-bit](https://renderdoc.org/stable/latest/RenderDoc_latest_64.msi) | [32-bit](https://renderdoc.org/stable/latest/RenderDoc_latest_32.msi)) or download the portable zip from the [builds page](https://renderdoc.org/builds). The 64-bit windows build fully supports capturing from 32-bit programs. On linux only 64-bit x86 is supported - there is a precompiled [binary tarball](https://renderdoc.org/stable/latest/renderdoc_latest.tar.gz) available, or your distribution may package it. If not you can [build from source](docs/CONTRIBUTING/Compiling.md).

Downloads
--------------

There are [binary releases](https://renderdoc.org/builds) available, built from the release targets. If you just want to use the program and you ended up here, this is what you want :).

It's recommended that if you're new you start with the stable builds. Nightly builds are available every day from the [v1.x branch here](https://renderdoc.org/builds#nightly) if you need it, but correspondingly may be less stable.

Documentation
--------------

The text documentation is available [online for the latest stable version](https://renderdoc.org/docs/), as well as in [renderdoc.chm](https://renderdoc.org/docs/renderdoc.chm) in any build. It's built from [restructured text with sphinx](docs).

As mentioned above there are some [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/baldurkarlsson) showing the use of some basic features and an introduction/overview.

There is also a great presentation by [@Icetigris](https://twitter.com/Icetigris) which goes into some details of how RenderDoc can be used in real world situations: [slides are up here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LQUMIld4SGoQVthnhT1scoA3k4Sg0as14G4NeSiSgFU/edit#slide=id.p).

Compiling
---------

Building RenderDoc is fairly straight forward on most platforms. See [Compiling.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING/Compiling.md) for more details.

Contributing & Development
--------------

I've added some notes on how to contribute, as well as where to get started looking through the code in [Developing-Change.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING/Developing-Change.md). All contribution information is available under [CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).
